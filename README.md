# Verilog RTL Design and Synthesis – Sky130 Workshop

Welcome, Evaluator.

This repository documents my progress through a 5-day workshop on **RTL Design and Synthesis** using open-source tools like **Icarus Verilog**, **GTKWave**, and **Yosys**. Each day focuses on specific concepts and practical labs related to digital design and synthesis using the Sky130 process.
